The shadows of a glorious past stretch long and deep, engulfing the lands in a somber embrace. The echoes of laughter, joy, and prosperity are now lost, replaced by the resounding silence of isolation and the lingering question: 'Will it ever be the same?' Once a beacon of enlightenment and progress, the world now bears the scars of an unknown catastrophe, a testament to the fragility of existence. The remnants of a once great civilization are now nothing more than scattered fragments, clinging to the hope of a future that seems ever so distant.

But for now, the world holds its breath, caught in a moment of stillness, waiting for a sign that it may one day be okay. As you approach the remnants of an ancient altar, the reality of your responsibility settles in. It's time to create your character, a beacon of muted hope in a world yearning for a chance at redemption. Your story, woven with threads of uncertainty and fragile hopes, is about to begin...",
