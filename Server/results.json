The more he gave himself to others and gave it the power to overcome the stress of being alone the less he would have to worry about being alone. \u00a0It was also the most wonderful time of his life. At the end of the day if he just held something for as long as he could without feeling guilty he would really feel his energy return to him and that would be amazing. And his other family life was pretty great too. We met with him once a month during which he often came to his friend's house, often brought him water, and brought him things he wanted, and we would go get him some and we would share meals, then he would spend the night talking and sometimes sleeping with a little water under the bed. He would play with a little bit of the toys when he was too drunk to do a thing and he just kept playing with them, going back and forth to his room until his friends came and we would do something to watch with him. It was so amazing and really special that he used to say, \"What a blessing is that you did this? That you can't do it all the time, but this is the first time I can do it all the time\".\nAs part of his day to day life he would leave a note on the door, saying he did not need to call friends in order to go home so he just came home alone and never thought about it again. He was a very humble man who would never make excuses for himself and did not have to rely on his own heart to reach his goals. He did not have to think about things or try to get a \"get rid of your old debt\" or deal with the financial difficulties of living alone. \u00a0He had been trying to improve himself since he was twelve years old and this was very important to him. The only thing he would remember of the whole experience was a happy ending on his birthday.\nThe next week, for some odd reason, when he got home from school, he decided he was going to be alone with his new girlfriend. He was very confused as to why she was the one who was going to have to leave. It was just really awkward. He also found it funny that he never really had a real date or family. \u00a0Now his only friends were his friends. \u00a0He would see them play at school and think they were the kids he was talking about while he was talking. He would also find that he could not actually have that long a date while he was alone. \u00a0Then the next morning he decided to try not to cry. \u00a0Then the next morning he decided to leave. \u00a0It was like a dream come true. He could have had a long, happy, happy time, and it would have been just the beginning for him and his family.\nAfter that day he started spending some time with her a few times as she seemed to stay at her place.\u00a0 She always seemed to always be smiling and always made me laugh and was always smiling back at me.\u00a0 She seemed to always talk about her new clothes, her new life, her new company and it was truly a joy to see her smile back and get a happy ending.\u00a0\nEven with all this, he kept calling her as she drove home from work but never really had a chance to meet up with her, so he always got tired of it and couldn't really do anything and eventually just left. He was so tired of it that he would just leave his old job and spend the rest of his day there.\nI wish that some other people from that day on were here who had a similar story. \u00a0Most of my old friends also had the same story too.\nSo as someone who was on the receiving end of these many \"honeymoon\" moments, I am wondering how many times I have to call them \"mama\" or \"honeymoon.\" \u00a0But I guess that is something for later.\u00a0", "model": "gpt2", "time": 51.86377191543579}, {"prompt": "Once upon a time ", "response": "Once upon a time \u300eSeize the day\u300f\n\n[1]\n\nAnd it is with great regret \u300eSeize the day\u300f: \"Hahahaha!

There was no competitor in the console market at that time. However, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox appeared a year later and Nintendo\u2019s Wii in 2006. The company\u2019s PlayStation 4 was released in 2013, setting a trend in the gaming industry. The latest Sony PlayStation, PS5 was launched in November 2020, at a time when technology has evolved to new horizons. So, which of these two consoles \u2013 PS4 or PS5 \u2013 has more games and which one is better? Let\u2019s find out more!\nIf you are a gaming enthusiast, you might have noticed that both the PS4 and PS5 come with unique features, advanced technologies, and, of course, a variety of exclusive games available. Both of these consoles feature amazing graphics, enabling a new level of immersion and realism. However, as the technology evolves, the consoles also evolve. Therefore, it\u2019s worth exploring the differences between both consoles to determine which one is the best buy for you.\nToday, we will compare the number of games, exclusives, and performance of the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and PlayStation 5 (PS5) and determine which of the two consoles is the right choice for you.\nPS4 Vs PS5: Which Console Has More Games?\nWith a variety of gaming titles available on each console, both PS4 and PS5 offer a different level of gameplay. However, it is essential to understand the gaming trends to find out whether PS5 or PS4 has more games. As of March 2021, PS4 has 4,063 games compared to the 4,015 available on PS5. Now, you might ask, \u201cHow does this matter if PS5 has only a few more games?\u201d The answer lies in whether both consoles feature the same genre and types of games.\nEven though the PS4 has more games available, it\u2019s essential to consider the age of the consoles and their lifecycle. It is true that PS4 has a larger game library, but it\u2019s unlikely that most of these games will still be relevant. However, a significant number of games might have been released on both platforms. Hence, whether you choose PS4 or PS5 depends on the specific games you want to play.\nLet\u2019s explore the types of games available on both consoles \u2013 exclusives and third-party games \u2013 to determine which one has more titles.\nPS4 Vs PS5: Exclusives And Third-Party Games\nA game console\u2019s exclusives are titles that are only available on that particular console. For example, if you play Mortal Kombat on PS4, it wouldn\u2019t be available on Xbox One.\nOn both PS4 and PS5, there are exclusive games that can only be played on these two consoles. The significant difference is that the PS5 offers a more extensive library of exclusives.\nPS4: God of War (PlayStation-exclusive), Bloodborne, and Persona 5, and many more games available in a limited time.\nPS5: God of War (2018) (PlayStation-exclusive), Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last of Us Part II, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and many more games available in the future.\nIn addition to the consoles\u2019 exclusive titles, third-party games are the games available on both systems. It is essential to understand that PS4 is a more mature platform that has been around for eight years, whereas PS5 is a newer console that has only been available for two years. In turn, PS5 has a smaller library of third-party games currently. However, it is growing with new titles that have been released, such as Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.\nWhat about games released on PS5 and then ported over to PS4? Sadly, not all third-party games are available on PS4 after their initial release. For example, NBA 2K21 and FIFA 21 are not available on PS4.\nGaming Performance Differences\nIf you take a close look at both consoles, you will find that their performance varies. Each console offers varying levels of graphics and resolution.\nPS5 \u2013 The PS5 has a specific GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) \u2013 AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT. This GPU offers higher 4K resolutions and enhances the graphics of games.

There was also a farmer who did not know when to quit. A hardworking man with an overflowing harvest, all he knew was to keep growing. His apples turned red, his corn turned yellow, and his pumpkins became orange, the small farm slowly becoming bigger and bigger. As days turned into nights, the farmer continued to cultivate.\nOne beautiful day, a wandering prince from a nearby kingdom passed by the town and noticed the burgeoning farmer. The prince was charmed by the fruitfulness of the farmer's fields. And as he left the square, it began to rain, the first rainfall of the season.\nThe prince returned the next day and noticed that his boots were wet, making him wonder about the town's cobblestone streets. Again, it began to rain, but this time, the prince decided to linger and watched a streetlight illuminate the bustling square. The farmer, with his overflowing harvest and sunlit fields, filled the prince's heart with warmth and hope.\nThat night, the prince returned to his kingdom and shared his experiences with the king. The king had a wicked stepmother who had made his life miserable. He was lonely, bitter, and seeking someone to talk to, but none of his ministers could hold a candle to the farmer's uplifting spirit.\nThe next day, the prince went back to the town and, after quitting his search for his kindred spirit, struck a deal with the farmer. The farmer agreed to leave the town and cultivate land in the prince's kingdom. The prince promised that the farmer's life would be forever changed and he would find happiness.\nThe fairy tale-like story ended with the farmer leaving his town for the prince's kingdom. As he crossed the threshold, the prince knew he had made the right choice and, for the first time, slept soundly that night. And in the morning, the prince woke up with a smile, knowing that he had finally found his missing half, the missing key to his life.\nThe farmer and the prince continued to work together, weaving a tapestry of love, growth, and passion that brought color and happiness to the kingdom. Together, they cultivated more land and reaped a life full of wonder, fulfilling the purpose of their fairy tale lives.\nFrom this, we learn that sometimes, our greatest challenges are the ones we are destined to overcome, making us the heroes of our own life stories. And the beauty of these tales lies in their beginnings, when our characters embark on a journey that only they could have understood.\nThe secret to a life filled with color, growth, and beauty lies within the framework of these stories.

It arrived alone and secretly in secret. What a pity, Dark Dragon was a little cowardly and did not warn any forest animals about his presence. When it was over Dark Dragon called on some of the other animals and announced his master. They were very quiet and did not know his voice and did not lift a hand. ADG said, \"Enough, some of you, I'm all you need.\"\n### Songs and conversations\n\nADG asked the other animals, including the little rabbit, if they heard the subject of the songs. They each looked at ADG questioningly. ADG repeated the subject with faster tempo after he had loudly talked to the rabbit. ADG said, \"You must have heard.\" The golden tungsten sword came from the screen and Thom Waiz\u00e9 hit ADG on the head, making his head spikes. Space animals called out to ADG and told that ADG was just telling the same story over and over again. ADG then asked a forest animal for some carrot cake. Forest animal spoke \"Good patience, I have this very delicious carrot cake for you.\" at him and displayed his carrot cake. As a result of this, ADG was very hungry and ordered more carrot cake. Forest animals asked ADG again if he heard. ADG nodded twice while whispering a melancholic song to him: \"we never over-f\ufffdrged, we can only survive the erosions of malevolence\". ADG slowly died with regret at the memory of his dream and reading the note from the cave magic cave, ADG sang: \"wake up from your nightmare and remember the aid of the forest that summoned your dream walking\".\n### Ending\n\nADG was about to die, but the forest animals knew only that there was still a little time until Dark Dragon roared a chorus about \"wayyyy too cozily dozz zeemzess\" and that RAT (SD dragon marshland riverbank labyrinth trap) RATTLE UNDER DM (DD) ISLAND TO BE ABANDONED!!

Here\u2019s the solution.\nSolution:\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss the situation when both pairs of people pull the switch.\nWhen both pairs of people pull the switch, it means half of the pot is emptied.

So in the end both people end up with 2 apples each.\nWhat should the formula be for the person who gets the other apple?\nIf one person gets 2 apples, the other person has to get 1 apple. One apple is enough for a person to eat, but another apple would be too many (two apple are equal to one apple). So the other person should get 1 apple.\nTo solve the other situation when each pair of people pulls the switch, follow the same procedure:\nOne person is given half of the pot, meaning they take 1 apple out of the pot. Another person pulls the switch, and gets the other half of the pot, meaning they take 1 apple out of the pot.\nTherefore, the other person would get 2 apples.\nIn the end, both people end up with 2 apples each, and the person who should get the other apple is the one who takes 2 apples.\n", "model": "Marx", "time": 102.32020854949951}, {"prompt": "Once upon a time ", "response": "Once upon a time 12-year-old Philmont enjoyed being invisible.
